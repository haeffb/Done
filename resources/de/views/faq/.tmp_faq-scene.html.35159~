<div class='helptopic'>1. Entering Trip Data</div>
<div class='helptext'>
Tap the Add a New Trip list item or command button to begin entry of a new trip. Enter 
beginning mileage and any other information you wish (vehicle, category, purpose, 
destination, notes). If you do not enter an ending mileage, a reminder will be set to
pop up after the selected time interval. You can return to the trip entry scene later to 
enter ending mileage and/or edit any of the data.<br>
If you have selecte the AutoFill mileage option in Preferences, the last entered ending
for the selected vehicle will be set as the beginning mileage of the new trip. The ending
mileage will be filled with all but the last three digits of the previous ending mileage.
Selecting a new vehicle will automatically change the beginning/ending mileage entries if
the AutoFill mileage option is turned on.
The begining date/time and ending date/time will be set to the time you created the trip
entry. If you later change or enter the ending mileage, the ending date/time will be
automatically changed if the AutoFill ending time option is turned on. You can edit the 
begining/ending date/time by tapping on the 
displayed date/time. You can also set either time to NOW by tapping on the clock icon.
