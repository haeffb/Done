<div class='helptopic'>1. On First Use</div>
<div class='helptext'>
In order to connect to Toodledo, you'll have to supply your <b>Toodledo login email and password</b>. This information
is saved in a TaskAdder cookie and used only to authenticate your requests to Toodledo. After entering your login
email and password, press the "Login to Toodledo" button. You'll only have to do this once.
</div>

<div class='helptopic'>2. Adding a Task</div>
<div class='helptext'>
Adding a task to Toodledo is a simple process. Enter the task name, and choose any of the other task
options as appropriate. Tap on the Add Task to Toodledo button. An <b>internet connection</b> must be 
available to connect to Toodledo.</div>

<div class='helptopic'>3. Viewing the Hotlist</div>
<div class='helptext'>
You can toggle between the Add Task and Hotlist views. When you switch to the Hotlist view, TaskAdder will 
show your Toodledo Hotlist. By default, any tasks with a due date within the next 7 days or earlier are
shown, along with any tasks with a priority of 3-Top. The number of days and priority are user-configurable 
in Preferences.</div>

<div class='helptopic'>4. Preferences</div>
<div class='helptext'>
TaskAdder preferences will allow you to change your Toodledo login information as well as set several
user-configurable options. Options are available for hotlist settings and for default values for the 
various task options. An option is
also available to set a task to repeat from the due date, or from the completion date. See Toodledo's help
for more information on task options.</div>
